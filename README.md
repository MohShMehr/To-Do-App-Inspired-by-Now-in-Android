# **To-Do App üìù**

A modern to-do list application for Android, built with best practices in mind, inspired by the official **Now in Android (Nia)** project. This app showcases a simple yet effective approach to building an Android application, incorporating elements of a clean architecture, UI with Jetpack Compose, and other foundational concepts learned from the Nia project.

## **Features**

* **Task Management**: Add, edit, and delete to-do items.  
* **Modern UI**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a declarative and intuitive user interface.  
* **Data Persistence**: Uses a local database to store tasks (coming soon).

## **Technologies and Architecture**

This project's architecture is heavily inspired by the **Now in Android** app and follows these key principles to ensure it is robust, scalable, and easy to maintain.

* **Modularization**: The project is split into different Gradle modules to promote a clean separation of concerns and reusability.  
* **Clean Architecture**: The codebase is structured with clear layers (UI, Domain, Data) to ensure testability and scalability.  
* **UI with Jetpack Compose**: The entire user interface is built with Jetpack Compose, leveraging its modern approach to UI development.  
* **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for managing dependencies and making the app more testable.  
* **State Management**: State is managed using Kotlin Flows and a unidirectional data flow pattern.
